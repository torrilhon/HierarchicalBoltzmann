Example geometry files for Gmsh and msh-files used in empirical error analysis
and simulation example.
 
    TwoCircleLarge.geo    // double cylinder geometry with radii 1/2 and 2
    ComplexChannel.geo    // curved channel with three obstacles

These files can be processed by the mesh generator Gmsh, see http://gmsh.info/

The generated `msh`-files can be read by the mesh library `MOAB`.
